        <p>“Life is my passion and food is life,” said Michael Martichelli. I have a love and hate relationship with food. I love to cook, and I love to eat but I’m always afraid of the repercussions of over indulging in my passion; hence why you’ll always find me at the gym. I only workout so I can eat. Over the years, I became familiarized with cooking and the culture I came from. My mother and grandmother have been an inspiration to me, they’ve taught me how to cook. My favorite dish as far as cooking is concerned is pineapple fired rice. Plus my love for travel also has had an influence on trying new foods and learning about different cultures. Food is a global language we all speak. </p>

        <p>I love to travel. It’s a passionate affair. Ever since I was a kid, I had a sense of adventure. Growing up in Kenya, my parents would always take my brother and I, on Safaris. The wildlife, the unknown of seeing something amazing like a Lion, getting to ride on a hundred year old Tortoise and getting to feed Giraffes; made me wonder what else was out there for me to explore. So far I’ve visited 26 countries and I am grateful to have at least one home each of the following continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don’t live for the future or the past, I just live in the moment. Being impulsive and saying ‘yes’ to nearly everything is part of the fun.</p>
